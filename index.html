    <h2> "Description" </h2>

        <p>  I love this easy Teriyaki chicken recipe for those nights when I donâ€™t have much time to get something on the table for dinner. The chicken takes minutes to make because I cut out the marinating and simply cook the chicken with the sauce. Of course a good marinade has its place but when you need dinner on the table fast, this recipe has got your back.</p>

        <h3> "Ingredients" </h3>
            <ul> 
                 
                Chicken breasts. Boneless skinless chicken breasts. You can use boneless chicken thighs too.
                Sesame oil. 
                Soy sauce. Coconut aminos or Tamari can be substituted. Low sodium soy sauce is also a good option.
                Rice vinegar.
                Sake/Mirin. (optional)
                Fresh Garlic. 
                Fresh Ginger.
                Honey.
                Brown sugar.

            </ul>

            <ol>

                Heat a large frying pan over high heat.

                Pat the chicken breast pieces dry with paper towels.
                
                Add the sesame oil to the pan followed by the chicken. Brown the chicken well on all sides then remove from the pan and set aside.

                Combine the remaining ingredients except for the sesame seeds. Pour into the pan.

                Allow the sauce to come to a boil and cook for 1-2 minutes until it starts to thicken then add the chicken and its resting juices back into the pan.

                Allow to cook for 4-5 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce is sticky and coating the chicken.

                Sprinkle over the sesame seeds and serve.
                
            </ol>
